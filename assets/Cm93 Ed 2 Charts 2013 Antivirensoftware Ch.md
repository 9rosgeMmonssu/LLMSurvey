## Advantages of Cm93 Ed 2 Charts
 
Cm93 Ed 2 Charts have some advantages over other types of charts, such as raster charts or paper charts. Some of these advantages are:

- They are compatible with many navigation software, such as OpenCPN, SeaIQ, and Antivirensoftware Chart Generator. This gives you more flexibility and choice in selecting the software that suits your needs and preferences.
- They cover most of the world's coastal waters, including some remote and less-charted areas. This gives you access to more information and data for your sailing destinations.
- They are updated regularly by C-Map, the company that produces them. The latest version of Cm93 Ed 2 Charts is from January 2011. This means they reflect the most recent changes and corrections in the chart data.
- They are relatively affordable compared to other types of charts, especially if you download them from unofficial sources. However, you should be aware that Cm93 Ed 2 Charts are copyrighted and C-Map would not be happy to see them being distributed without their permission.

- They are not official charts and they are not approved for navigation by any authority. They are intended for planning and reference purposes only. You should always use official charts and other sources of information when navigating.
- They may contain errors or inaccuracies in some areas, especially in less-charted or dynamic regions. You should always verify the chart data with your own observations and instruments, such as GPS, radar, depth sounder, etc.
- They may not include some features or details that are important for navigation, such as buoys, lights, tides, currents, etc. You should always consult other sources of information for these features.
- They may not be compatible with some navigation software or devices that use different formats or encryption methods. For example, Cm93 Ed 3 Charts are encoded in version 3 of the S57 format and OpenCPN does not read that format [^2^]. You should always check the compatibility of your charts with your software or device before using them.

Cm93 Ed 2 Charts are a useful and convenient source of chart data for many sailors around the world. They have many advantages over other types of charts, but they also have some limitations and drawbacks. You should always use them with caution and common sense, and never rely on them as your sole source of information for navigation.
