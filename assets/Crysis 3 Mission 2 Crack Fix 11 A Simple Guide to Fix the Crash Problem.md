These are the files that you will need to replace in your game directory.
 
## Step 2: Replace Game Files
 
The next step is to replace the original game files with the cracked ones. To do this, you will need to locate your game installation folder. This is usually in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Crysis 3\Bin32" or "C:\Program Files\Origin Games\Crysis 3\Bin32", depending on your system architecture.
 
Before you replace any files, make sure you backup the original ones in case something goes wrong. You can do this by copying them to another folder or renaming them with a different extension. Then, copy and paste the cracked files ("Crysis3.exe" and "rldea.dll") from the crack fix folder to your game directory. Overwrite any existing files when prompted.
 
## Step 3: Block Game Exes from Going Online
 
The final step is to block the game exes from going online. This is to prevent any potential conflicts or updates that might interfere with the crack fix. You can do this by using a firewall program, such as Windows Firewall or Comodo Firewall.
 
To block the game exes from going online using Windows Firewall, follow these steps:
 
- Open Control Panel and click on System and Security.
- Click on Windows Defender Firewall and then click on Advanced Settings on the left panel.
- Click on Outbound Rules and then click on New Rule on the right panel.
- Select Program and then click Next.
- Browse for your game executable ("Crysis3.exe") in your game directory and then click Next.
- Select Block the connection and then click Next.
- Select all three options (Domain, Private, Public) and then click Next.
- Give a name and a description for your rule and then click Finish.

Repeat these steps for the other game executable ("rldea.dll") in your game directory.
