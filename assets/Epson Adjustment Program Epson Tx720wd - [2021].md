# How to Reset Epson TX720WD Printer with Adjustment Program
 
If you have an Epson TX720WD printer that is showing errors such as "Service required" or "Ink pad is at the end of its service life", you may need to reset it using an adjustment program. An adjustment program is a software tool that can reset the internal counters of your printer and restore its functionality. Here are the steps to reset your Epson TX720WD printer with an adjustment program:
 
1. Download the adjustment program for Epson TX720WD from [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFIUYxzkMJM) [^1^] or [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGOf4H2vkwo) [^2^]. You may need to enter a password to extract the file.
2. Run the adjustment program as administrator and select your printer model and port.
3. Click on "Particular adjustment mode" and select "Waste ink pad counter" from the list.
4. Click on "Check" to see the current values of the counters. Then click on "Initialization" to reset them to zero.
5. Turn off your printer and wait for a few seconds. Then turn it on again and check if the error message is gone.

Congratulations! You have successfully reset your Epson TX720WD printer with an adjustment program. You can now use your printer normally. However, keep in mind that resetting the counters does not solve the problem of the waste ink pads. The waste ink pads are sponge-like components that absorb the excess ink during printing and cleaning cycles. Over time, they may become saturated and leak ink, causing damage to your printer and the environment. Therefore, it is recommended that you replace the waste ink pads or install an external waste ink tank to avoid future problems. You can find more information about how to do this in [the service manual](https://manualmachine.com/epson/px710/8622068-service-manual/) [^3^] of your printer.
