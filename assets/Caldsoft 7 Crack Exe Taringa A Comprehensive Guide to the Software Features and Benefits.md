Hichki is a 2018 Hindi comedy drama film that tells the story of Naina Mathur, a woman who dreams of becoming a teacher but faces rejection due to her Tourette syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes her to make involuntary sounds. The film is based on the autobiography of Brad Cohen, an American motivational speaker who also has Tourette syndrome and became a successful teacher.
 
The film stars Rani Mukerji as Naina, who finally gets a chance to teach at her alma mater, St. Notker's School. However, she is assigned to teach a group of underprivileged students from a nearby slum, who are seen as troublemakers and outcasts by the school authorities. Naina faces many challenges and prejudices from her colleagues, students and their parents, but she does not give up on her mission to educate and inspire them.

Hichki has received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences, who have praised the film for its uplifting and inspiring message. The film has been lauded for its portrayal of Tourette syndrome and its impact on the lives of those who suffer from it. The film also highlights the issues of social inequality, discrimination and lack of opportunities faced by the underprivileged sections of society.
 
The film's biggest strength is Rani Mukerji's performance as Naina Mathur. She delivers a nuanced and convincing portrayal of a woman who does not let her disorder define her or stop her from pursuing her passion. She brings out the humour, emotion and determination of her character with ease and grace. She also shares a great chemistry with the young actors who play her students, who are equally impressive in their roles.
 
Hichki is not without its flaws though. The film follows a predictable and formulaic plot that borrows heavily from other films in the genre. The film also glosses over some of the harsh realities and challenges faced by the slum dwellers and their children. The film could have explored more dimensions of Naina's personal and professional life, rather than focusing on her disorder alone.
 
Despite these shortcomings, Hichki is a film that will make you smile, cry and cheer for its protagonist and her students. It is a film that celebrates the human spirit and the power of education. It is a film that reminds you that everyone has a hiccup in their life, but it is up to you to overcome it and turn it into your strength.
