Zenonia 2: The Lost Memories is the sequel to the popular action role-playing game Zenonia, developed and published by Gamevil. It was released for iOS and Android devices in 2010, but it was never officially ported to the PlayStation Portable (PSP). However, some fans have managed to create an unofficial PSP version of the game, which can be downloaded and played on a PSP emulator or a hacked PSP console.
 
Zenonia 2 follows the adventures of four different characters: Lu, Morpice, Ecne, and Daza. Each character has their own storyline, class, skills, and weapons. The game features a dynamic alignment system that changes depending on the player's choices and actions. The game also has a rich and colorful world to explore, with hundreds of quests, items, enemies, and secrets. The game has a retro-style graphics and sound that evoke the nostalgia of classic RPGs.
