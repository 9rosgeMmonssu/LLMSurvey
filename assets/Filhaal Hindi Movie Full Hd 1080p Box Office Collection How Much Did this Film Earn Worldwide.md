Filhaal is not just a film, but a reflection of the realities of surrogacy in India. Surrogacy is a controversial and sensitive issue that involves legal, ethical and social aspects. Surrogacy is the process of hiring a woman to carry and deliver a child for another person or couple who are unable to do so. Surrogacy can be altruistic or commercial, depending on whether the surrogate mother is paid or not.
 
In India, surrogacy is legal but unregulated. There are no clear laws or guidelines to protect the rights and interests of the surrogate mothers, the intended parents and the children born through surrogacy. There are many cases of exploitation, abuse and fraud in the surrogacy industry. There are also many ethical and moral dilemmas involved in surrogacy, such as the commodification of women's bodies, the commercialization of reproduction, the violation of human dignity and the potential harm to the children's identity and well-being.
 
Filhaal raises awareness and sparks debate about these issues through its realistic and nuanced depiction of surrogacy. The film shows the positive and negative aspects of surrogacy, the challenges and risks faced by the surrogate mothers and the intended parents, and the emotional and psychological consequences of surrogacy on all the parties involved. The film also questions the social norms and expectations that pressure women to become mothers and stigmatize those who are unable to do so.
 
Filhaal is a film that will make you think about the meaning of love, friendship and family in the context of surrogacy. It will make you empathize with the characters and their struggles. It will make you appreciate the sacrifices and choices made by women who opt for surrogacy or become surrogate mothers. It will make you realize that surrogacy is not a simple or easy solution, but a complex and controversial phenomenon that needs more awareness, regulation and support.
