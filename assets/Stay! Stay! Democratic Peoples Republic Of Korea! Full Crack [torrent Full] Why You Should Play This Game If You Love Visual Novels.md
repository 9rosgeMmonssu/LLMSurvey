Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic Of Korea! is not a typical dating sim game. It is a parody of another game called Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~, which was a romantic comedy about visiting Japan. The developers of Stay! Stay! DPRK! wanted to create a similar game, but with a twist. They chose North Korea as the setting, because they thought it would be funny and interesting to explore the contrast between the two countries.
 
The game is not meant to offend or mock anyone. It is a satire that uses humor and exaggeration to make fun of the stereotypes and propaganda about North Korea. The game does not support or endorse the regime or its actions. It is a fictional story that does not reflect the real situation or people in North Korea.
 
The game is also not meant to be taken seriously. It is a comedy that does not follow any logic or realism. The characters and events are absurd and ridiculous. The game does not try to educate or inform the players about North Korea. It is a game that is meant to entertain and amuse the players.
