The movie stars Gong Yoo as Kang In-ho, a widowed father who takes a job as an art teacher at the school. He soon notices that some of the students have bruises and scars, and that they are terrified of their teachers and principal. He also meets Seo Yu-jin, a human rights activist who is investigating the school. Together, they discover that the children are being systematically raped and tortured by the staff, who use their disability and poverty as a means of control.
 
Silenced is a gripping and heartbreaking movie that exposes the corruption and injustice that allowed the abuse to continue for years. The movie also shows the courage and resilience of the victims, who struggle to find their voice and seek justice. The movie sparked public outrage and social change in Korea, leading to the revision of the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse cases and the strengthening of child protection laws.
 
Silenced is available to watch on Netflix and other streaming platforms. You can also download it from various torrent sites, such as YTS.mx. However, be warned that the movie contains graphic scenes of violence and sexual assault that may be disturbing for some viewers.

The movie had a huge impact on the Korean society and culture, as it sparked public outrage and demand for legislative reform. The movie was watched by over 4 million people in Korea, including celebrities, politicians, and activists who voiced their support for the victims and their condemnation of the perpetrators. The movie also inspired online petitions, protests, and donations for the victims' welfare and education. [1]
 
The movie's influence reached the National Assembly of Korea, where a revised bill, dubbed the Dogani Bill, was passed in late October 2011 to abolish the statute of limitations for sex crimes against minors and disabled people. The bill also increased the minimum sentence for such crimes from 3 years to 5 years, and allowed for chemical castration of repeat offenders. [2]
 
The movie also raised awareness and discussion about the human rights of the deaf community and other marginalized groups in Korea. The movie highlighted the lack of communication and accessibility for deaf people, as well as the stigma and discrimination they face in society. The movie also challenged the stereotypes and prejudices about deaf people, showing them as resilient and courageous individuals who can overcome their trauma and pursue their dreams. [3]
 
Silenced is a movie that not only tells a harrowing story of abuse and injustice, but also inspires hope and change for a better future. It is a movie that deserves to be seen and heard by everyone who cares about human dignity and rights.
