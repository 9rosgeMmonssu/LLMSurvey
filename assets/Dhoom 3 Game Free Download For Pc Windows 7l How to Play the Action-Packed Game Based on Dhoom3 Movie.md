## Dhoom:3 The Game - Tips and Tricks to Master the Game
 
If you want to become the best racer and heist master in Dhoom:3 The Game, you need to know some tips and tricks that will help you improve your skills and score. Here are some of them:

- Use the nitro boost wisely. The nitro boost can give you a speed boost and help you escape from the cops, but it also consumes your energy. You can refill your energy by collecting coins or power-ups, or by performing stunts. Use the nitro boost only when you need it, and don't waste it on straight roads.
- Perform stunts to earn more points and coins. You can perform stunts by swiping up or down on the screen when you are in the air. Stunts can also refill your energy and nitro boost, so try to do them as often as possible. However, be careful not to crash or land badly, as that will reduce your health and score.
- Avoid obstacles and traffic. Obstacles and traffic can slow you down and damage your health. You can avoid them by swiping left or right on the screen to change lanes, or by jumping over them using ramps. You can also use power-ups like magnets, shields, or rockets to help you clear the way.
- Upgrade your bike and rider. You can upgrade your bike and rider using the coins you earn from playing the game. Upgrading your bike can improve its speed, acceleration, handling, and durability. Upgrading your rider can improve his health, energy, nitro boost, and stunt skills. You can also unlock new bikes and locations by completing missions and achievements.
- Compete with other players online. You can challenge other players online in the leaderboard mode or the multiplayer mode. In the leaderboard mode, you can compare your scores with other players around the world. In the multiplayer mode, you can race against other players in real time.
