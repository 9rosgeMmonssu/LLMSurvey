# How to Download Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton in English for Free
 
Principia Mathematica is one of the most influential works in the history of science, written by Isaac Newton in the 17th century. It contains his laws of motion, his theory of universal gravitation, and his mathematical methods for solving problems in physics and astronomy.
 
If you are interested in reading this masterpiece, you might be wondering how to get a free copy of it in English. Fortunately, there are some online sources that offer free downloads of Principia Mathematica in PDF format. Here are some steps to follow:

1. Go to [this link](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Newton/Principia/Bk1Sect1/PrBk1St1.pdf), which is a PDF file of the first section of Book 1 of Principia Mathematica, translated into English by Andrew Motte and edited by David R. Wilkins[^1^]. This is the most important part of the book, where Newton introduces his laws of motion and his principle of universal gravitation.
2. Right-click on the PDF file and choose "Save as" or "Download" to save it on your computer or device.
3. Repeat the same process for the other sections of Book 1, which are available at [this website](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Newton/Principia/). You can also find the sections of Book 2 and Book 3 there, as well as some supplementary materials.
4. Alternatively, you can download the entire Principia Mathematica in one PDF file from [this link](https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich), which is a scanned copy of the original Latin edition with an English translation by Florian Cajori. However, this version might be less readable and accurate than the one by Motte and Wilkins.

By following these steps, you can enjoy reading Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton in English for free. You will be able to learn from one of the greatest minds of all time and appreciate his contributions to science and mathematics.

Principia Mathematica is divided into three books, each with several sections and propositions. Here is a brief overview of the main topics covered in each book:
 
## Book 1: The Motion of Bodies
 
This book deals with the motion of bodies under the influence of forces, such as gravity, inertia, and resistance. Newton introduces his three laws of motion, which are the foundation of classical mechanics. He also defines the concepts of mass, momentum, force, impulse, and work. He then applies his laws to various problems involving the motion of particles, projectiles, pendulums, and collisions. He also derives the law of universal gravitation, which states that every mass attracts every other mass with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance. He uses this law to explain the motion of planets and comets around the sun, as well as the tides and the precession of the equinoxes.
 
## Book 2: The Motion of Fluids
 
This book deals with the motion of fluids, such as air and water. Newton studies how fluids resist the motion of bodies immersed in them, and how they exert pressure on their boundaries. He also investigates how fluids flow through pipes and channels, and how they produce sound and waves. He also discusses the properties of sound, light, heat, and electricity in relation to fluids.
 
## Book 3: The System of the World
 
This book deals with the application of Newton's laws and principles to the system of the world, or the solar system. Newton uses his law of universal gravitation to calculate the orbits and periods of the planets and their satellites, as well as their perturbations due to mutual attraction. He also explains how to measure the masses and densities of celestial bodies, and how to determine their distances and sizes. He also shows how his theory agrees with the observations and discoveries made by astronomers such as Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Tycho Brahe.
 
Principia Mathematica is a monumental work that revolutionized science and mathematics. It established Newton as one of the greatest scientists of all time, and influenced many generations of thinkers and researchers. It is a testament to his genius and creativity.
