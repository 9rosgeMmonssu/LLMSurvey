By following the NSCP, you can ensure that your structures are compliant with the national and international standards and best practices. You can also avoid potential errors, failures, and liabilities that may arise from poor or inadequate design and construction. You can also contribute to the development and improvement of the structural engineering profession and industry in the Philippines.

The NSCP is divided into several chapters and sections that cover different topics and aspects of structural design and construction. Some of the main chapters are:
 
- Chapter 1: General Provisions. This chapter defines the scope, objectives, and applicability of the NSCP. It also provides the definitions, symbols, units, and abbreviations used throughout the code.
- Chapter 2: Loads and Load Combinations. This chapter specifies the types and magnitudes of loads that structures must resist, such as dead loads, live loads, wind loads, earthquake loads, snow loads, rain loads, temperature effects, and others. It also provides the methods and formulas for combining different loads and determining the design load effects.
- Chapter 3: Materials. This chapter lists the properties and specifications of various materials used for structural design and construction, such as concrete, steel, wood, masonry, glass, plastics, composites, and others. It also provides the criteria and procedures for testing and quality control of materials.
- Chapter 4: Analysis. This chapter describes the methods and assumptions for analyzing the behavior and response of structures under various load conditions. It covers topics such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, linear analysis, nonlinear analysis, elastic analysis, plastic analysis, stability analysis, and others.
- Chapter 5: Foundations. This chapter deals with the design and construction of foundations that support structures and transfer loads to the ground. It covers topics such as soil mechanics, bearing capacity, settlement, lateral earth pressure, shallow foundations, deep foundations, pile foundations, caisson foundations, mat foundations, retaining walls, and others.

The NSCP also has chapters on specific types of structures or structural elements, such as concrete structures (Chapter 6), steel structures (Chapter 7), wood structures (Chapter 8), masonry structures (Chapter 9), precast structures (Chapter 10), composite structures (Chapter 11), special structures (Chapter 12), seismic design (Chapter 13), wind design (Chapter 14), fire design (Chapter 15), and others.
