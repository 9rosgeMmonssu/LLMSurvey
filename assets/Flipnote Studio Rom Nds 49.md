FSPDS is a homebrew ROM that allows you to play flipnotes on your DS using a flashcard. It supports both USA and EUR versions of Flipnote Studio, and it has some features like screen saver, bottom-screen tabs, and BGM playback. In this article, we will show you how to use FSPDS and where to download it.
  
## What You Need
 
- A Nintendo DS or DS Lite console
- A compatible flashcard (such as R4, Acekard, etc.)
- A microSD card with enough space for your flipnotes and FSPDS ROM
- A computer with a card reader
- Some flipnotes that you want to play (you can export them from your DSi or download them from the internet)
- The FSPDS ROM file (you can get it from GitHub[^1^] or other sources)

## How to Use FSPDS

1. Create a new folder named `/flipnotes` at the root of your microSD card.
2. Copy your favorite flipnotes to the `/flipnotes` directory. They should have the extension `.ppm`.
3. Copy the FSPDS.nds file anywhere to your microSD card.
4. Insert your flashcard into the DS, then turn on the console.
5. Launch FSPDS.nds from your flashcard menu.
6. Select a file from the menu using the D-pad.
7. Press A to play it.
8. Use L / R buttons to navigate through bottom-screen tabs.

## Tips and Tricks

- If you are a TwilightMenu++ user (or any other DSi CFW), or you use the same SD card for both the DSi and a DS flashcard, FSPDS automatically detects default flipnote export paths for you so that you are not required to copy those files to a `/flipnotes` directory.
- A screen saver turns off the bottom screen on 5 seconds of inactivity during flipnote playback. Also, this option can be manually triggered by pressing the screen saver icon on the Player Tab.
- FSPDS doesn't detect/play flipnotes larger than 1MB (this is intentional behavior).
- The flipnote's BGM track should be smaller than 512KB in order to be played correctly. However, the DSi Flipnote Studio only allows for 1 minute of raw audio (8192Hz) to be encoded into a flipnote, which means at most 240KB of sound data. Therefore, FSPDS should not have problems playing original flipnotes. Spin-off flipnotes which contain huge audio data may not play correctly with this application.

## Conclusion
 
FSPDS is a great way to enjoy your flipnotes on Nintendo DS without having to hack your DSi or use an emulator. It is easy to use and has some nice features. If you want to try it out, you can download it from GitHub[^1^] or other sources. You can also check out some screenshots and videos of FSPDS in action on Reddit[^2^] or YouTube. Have fun!
