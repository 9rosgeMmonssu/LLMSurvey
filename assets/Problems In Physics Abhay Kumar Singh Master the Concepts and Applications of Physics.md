The book has received positive reviews from readers who found it useful, challenging, and comprehensive. Some of the reviews are:
 
- "Can someone tell me where will this book be available ???? Please" [^1^]
- "abhay kumar singh problems in physics" [^1^]
- "I would suggest this excellent collection of advanced physics problems to be used as a main source of literature for all sorts of physics competitions and olympiads." [^3^]
- "Excellent book" [^3^]

The book is available on Google Books [^1^], Goodreads [^2^], and Amazon [^3^]. It is published by New Age International, 2007, with ISBN 8122412432, 9788122412437.
 
If you are looking for a book that will challenge your physics knowledge and skills, Problems In Physics by Abhay Kumar Singh might be a good choice for you.
  
One of the features of the book is that it provides multiple ways of solving the same problem, using different concepts and techniques. This helps the students to compare and contrast the different methods and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each one. For example, in the chapter on mechanics, the book shows how to solve problems involving collisions, circular motion, work and energy, and rotational dynamics using different approaches such as conservation laws, vector analysis, and calculus.
 
Another feature of the book is that it explains the physical meaning and significance of the solutions, rather than just giving the final answers. The book also provides hints and tips on how to approach a physics problem, such as identifying the given data, drawing diagrams, choosing appropriate equations, checking units and dimensions, and verifying the results. The book also includes some historical and biographical notes on some of the famous physicists and their contributions to the field.
 
The book is suitable for students who have a good grasp of the basic concepts and principles of physics and who want to improve their problem solving skills. The book can also be used by teachers and instructors as a reference and a source of problems for assignments and tests. The book is not meant to be a substitute for a textbook or a lecture, but rather a supplement and a challenge for the students who want to excel in physics.
  
In conclusion, Problems In Physics by Abhay Kumar Singh is a book that offers a variety of problems and solutions in physics for students at the +2 stage and the 1st year engineering course. The book covers topics such as mechanics, heat, optics, electro dynamics, and modern physics, and provides different approaches to solving the same problem.
