## Some Features of Adobe Encore CS6
 
Adobe Encore CS6 has many features that make it a powerful and versatile software for creating DVDs, Blu-ray discs, and web DVDs. Here are some of them:

- 64-bit Encore CS6: You can speed up your workflow and get rock-solid, native 64-bit performance and stability. You can open and save projects fast, and get dramatic performance working on demanding projects.
- High-quality DVD and Blu-ray authoring: You can get extensive functionality when authoring DVDs and Blu-ray discs. Encore CS6 supports Blu-ray chapter playlists, 8-bit color highlight buttons, and menu color enhancements. You can also create slide shows with up to 999 slides.
- Fast MPEG import: You can bring MPEG assets into Encore CS6 fast, as multiple import processes happen simultaneously in the background.
- DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and web DVD authoring: You can efficiently create DVDs, Blu-ray discs, and web DVDs, all from a single project. You can also send your Adobe Premiere Pro sequences directly to Encore without rendering first.
- Flowchart: You can define and view the navigation of your DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and web DVD projects by using a visual representation of all points and links. You can also use variable zoom to speed up your workflow.
- Powerful web DVD authoring: You can create web DVDs that replicate all the functionality of their Blu-ray Disc counterparts, thanks to support for pop-up menus, multipage menus, and menu looping playback. You can also customize encoding presets for more control.
- Sleek interface for web DVD titles: You can create web DVDs that have a sleek interface, offering easy-to-use playback controls plus the option to watch HD video in full-screen mode.
- Integrated search for web DVD titles: You can engage viewers effectively with keyword-searchable web DVDs. Encore uses metadata from menu and button names, speech analysis, and subtitles to make web DVDs searchable.
- Background batch encoding: You can work efficiently by offloading transcoding jobs to Adobe Media Encoder, freeing Encore for other tasks. This is particularly important with 4K and 5K workflows that normally tax your system.
- Third-party encoding integration: You can choose the right encoder for the job without sacrificing efficiency. You can integrate third-party encoders with the Encore workflow to tap into advances in GPU-accelerated encoding.
- Cross-platform projects: You can share Encore projects without worrying about platform compatibility. Encore projects can be moved between WindowsÂ® and Mac platforms freely, without conversion.
