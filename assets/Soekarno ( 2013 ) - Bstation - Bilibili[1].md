Free Download Film Soekarno Terbaru is a must-watch for anyone who wants to learn more about one of the most influential figures in Indonesian history. It is a film that celebrates the spirit of nationalism and independence that Soekarno embodied.
  
One of the highlights of the film is the depiction of Soekarno's speech at the Bandung Conference in 1955. The Bandung Conference was a historic meeting of Asian and African leaders who sought to promote cooperation and solidarity among the newly independent nations. Soekarno delivered a powerful speech that called for a rejection of colonialism and imperialism, and a promotion of peace and justice. The speech earned him international recognition and respect, and inspired many other leaders to follow his example.
 
Another memorable scene in the film is the confrontation between Soekarno and Suharto, his successor and former ally. Suharto staged a coup in 1965, accusing Soekarno of being involved in a communist plot to overthrow the government. Suharto then placed Soekarno under house arrest and stripped him of his presidential powers. The film shows the tense and emotional exchange between the two men, as Soekarno tries to defend his legacy and Suharto tries to justify his actions.
 
The film ends with a poignant montage of Soekarno's funeral in 1970, attended by millions of Indonesians who mourned his death. The film also shows how Soekarno's ideals and vision continue to live on in the hearts and minds of many Indonesians today, who regard him as a national hero and a symbol of freedom.
