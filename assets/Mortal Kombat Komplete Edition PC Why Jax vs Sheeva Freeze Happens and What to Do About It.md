## Causes of the Freeze
 
The freezing issue is caused by a graphics error that occurs when Jax performs his X-Ray move on Sheeva. The game tries to load a high-resolution texture for Sheeva's skin, but fails to do so and crashes. This error only affects the PC version of the game, and does not happen on consoles.
 
## Solutions for the Freeze
 
There are two possible solutions for this issue. The first one is to skip the cutscene where Jax performs his X-Ray move on Sheeva. To do this, you need to press Esc right before the cutscene starts, and then select "Skip Fight". This will allow you to continue the story mode without freezing. However, this means that you will miss some of the story and gameplay elements.
 
The second solution is to replace the faulty texture file with a fixed one. To do this, you need to download a mod that contains the re-encoded files from the PS3 version of the game, which have improved video and sound quality. The mod supports all languages for the game, and does not affect any other aspect of the game. To install the mod, follow these steps:
 
1. Download the mod from [this link](https://trello.com/c/eDLcF7Oz/246-mortal-kombat-komplete-edition-pc-jax-vs-sheeva-freeze-fix-install).[^3^]
2. Go to your game folder (usually located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MKKE\DiscContentPC\Movies`).
3. Move and replace the files in the mod with the ones in your game folder.
4. Launch the game and enjoy.

## Conclusion
 
Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition PC is a great fighting game that offers hours of fun and entertainment. However, it also has some technical issues that can ruin your experience. One of them is the Jax vs Sheeva freeze, which can be fixed by either skipping the cutscene or installing a mod. We hope this article helped you solve this problem and enjoy the game without any hassle.
  
## Review of the Game
 
Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition PC is a great fighting game that offers hours of fun and entertainment. It has a large and diverse roster of characters, each with their own unique moves, fatalities, and X-ray attacks. The game also has a variety of modes to choose from, such as the story mode, the arcade mode, the challenge tower, and the online multiplayer. The game's graphics are crisp and detailed, and the sound effects and voice acting are well done. The game also runs smoothly on most PCs, with minimal bugs or glitches.
 
However, the game also has some drawbacks that may deter some players. The game's story mode is cheesy and cliched, and the cutscenes are low quality and compressed. The game's difficulty can be frustrating at times, especially in some boss fights and challenge tower missions. The game's online community is also very small and hard to find matches with. The game's tone and style may also not appeal to everyone, as it is very violent, gory, and sexist. The game does not shy away from showing blood, bones, organs, and severed limbs in its brutal attacks.
